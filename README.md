# Codewars-Coding-Exercises
A variety of coding exercises (of varying difficulty) meant to demonstrate skills and technique in Python. 
Most of the challenges (kata) are from Codewars.com. I tried to included all the requirements/prompts for each challenge
inside the triple quotes in the Jupyter notebook. The code themselves aren't heavily commented because I assume the
reader has some familiarity with Python syntax. I know, not best practice.

It's also important to note that the codes passed randomized tests on the Codewars website within the assignment's requirements/constraints. 
I cannot guarantee they'll work at all if an incorrect data type is passed through the functions. 


I will update the notebook when I have completed more exercises. Looking to add more math based exercises along with Leetcode stuff as 
they are more challenging.
